🧠 Week 4 Assignment: AI in Software Engineering

Theme: Building Intelligent Software Solutions 💻🤖


---

📘 Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Software Engineering, focusing on how AI enhances development efficiency, automates testing, and supports ethical, data-driven decision-making.

The repository and accompanying report are organized to reflect the three major components of the assignment — Theoretical Analysis, Practical Implementation, and Ethical Reflection. Each part follows a clear, consistent syntax and structure to ensure readability, reproducibility, and assessment clarity.
